# hello-world
A line of code to mark the beginning of my digital endeavor 

I'm Ed and this year (2022) I have decided to begin implementing programing into my daily life. My intent is to become familiar and develop a few projects every 3 month depending on my knowledge level. I do have a busy life which takes up a majority of my time, but my creative itch has been suppressed for far to long. I can't wait to follow up on this post next year and track my progress!
